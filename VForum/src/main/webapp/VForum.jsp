			<legend> Why VFORUM? </legend>
			<section class="vforum_desc">Well, VFORUM is a Virtusa
				Community which provides all the employees in an organization a
				place to raise doubts and answer the doubts they have previously
				faced and solved. Employees answering the question will have a clear
				idea of what they are dealing with. As the sharing of knowledge is
				main objective here, all the employees will interact with each other
				properly. Any technical or a general doubt is all what an employee
				of an organization will face, so the best solution can be with other
				employees of the organization who already have solved it. So in turn
				saving time and not disturbing people at work will be an efficient
				way of working.</section>
